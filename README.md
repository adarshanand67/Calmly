## Calmly - Frontend

As developer of Calmly, I faced several challenges while creating the frontend of the project. The first and biggest challenge was creating a seamless user experience for our users. I had to ensure that the website was easy to navigate and provided all the necessary information in an organized and easy-to-digest format.

To overcome this challenge, I started by creating a well-structured project structure and organizing all the different components and pages in a logical and consistent manner. I also added a navigation bar at the top of the page for easy navigation between pages and a footer to the bottom of the page.

Next, I created several reusable components such as dropdown menus, modals, spinners, and text components. These components were used throughout the application to provide a consistent look and feel. I also created a component to handle the display of charts, which is used to display various data points on the website.

To enhance the look and feel of the website, I used DaisyUI, a library for building user interfaces, along with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. These tools allowed me to create a visually appealing and modern design that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

To achieve this, I made use of React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provided the flexibility and efficiency needed to create a dynamic and responsive frontend. I also utilized React Router DOM, a routing library for React, to manage the navigation of the website and provide a smooth experience for users as they navigate through the site.

I also created an "About Us" section, which provides information about the team behind the project. This section includes a brief description of each team member, as well as links to their social media profiles. This section also includes a link to the GitHub repository, which allows users to view the source code for the project.

Overall, the frontend of Calmly was designed to provide a simple and intuitive experience for users, while also being robust and flexible enough to handle the complex requirements of a mental health application. With the combination of these technologies, I was able to create a frontend that was both functional and visually appealing, and met all the needs of our users.
